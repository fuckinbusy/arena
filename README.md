# Arena Allocator

[Arena Allocator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management) implementation in pure C as an [stb-style single-file library](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

*I just caught myself implementing this over and over again in my projects, so I decided to turn it into a copy-pastable library similar to [sv](http://github.com/tsoding/sv)*

## Quick Start

> The truly reusable code is the one that you can simply copy-paste.

The library itself does not require any special building. You can simple copy-paste [./arena.h](./arena.h) to your project and `#include` it.

```c
TODO
```
